## ðŸ“‚ Current Work

### 1. Ethereal Mission Design Task
**Prepared by:** [Sidhartha Maurya ](https://github.com/msidhartha10)

This task involves the trajectory and mission design for a two-stage launch vehicle from SDSC, SHAR to a Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  

**Key highlights:**
- Î”V budget calculations including gravity, drag, thrust, and steering losses.
- Launch azimuth computation for prograde and retrograde orbits.
- Mass and payload analysis for direct ascent and Hohmann transfer strategies.
- Burnout time, altitude, velocity, and downrange predictions.
- Propellant and liftoff mass scaling for increased payload.
- Equations of motion derived under gravitational, aerodynamic, and thrust influences.
- Optimal control problem formulation using Pontryaginâ€™s principle.
- Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis (atmospheric density, thrust variations, wind disturbances, initial launch deviations).
